## Projects
**Driver Drowsiness Detection System**

[Project Report (PDF)](Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_System.pdf) | [Source Code](https://github.com/Pham-Hoang-Phuc/Drowsiness-detection/tree/main)

Developed a real-time Computer Vision system to detect driver fatigue using webcam video, designed with a modular and high-speed processing pipeline powered by MediaPipe.

### Key Features

#### Eye State Classification (Open/Closed):
- Built a custom lightweight CNN achieving 98.70% accuracy, optimized for low-latency real-time deployment.

#### Yawn Detection (Hybrid MAR-CNN):
- Implemented a dual-verification method combining geometric Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) + CNN.
→ Reduced false positives compared to MAR-only approaches.

#### Real-time System Architecture:

- Facial landmark detection via MediaPipe

- Eye & mouth ROI extraction module

- Hybrid classification engine

- Alert trigger subsystem

#### My Contributions
- Built a complete pipeline including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  
- Implemented facial landmark extraction and real-time processing with OpenCV and MediaPipe.
  
- Developed custom CNN models for eye state classification and yawn detection.
