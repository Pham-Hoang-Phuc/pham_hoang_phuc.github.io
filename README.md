## Projects
**Drowsiness Detection**
Developed a real-time Computer Vision system to monitor driver fatigue using webcam video. The system's modular pipeline ensures high efficiency by leveraging MediaPipe for high-speed facial tracking.

Eye State Classification (Closed/Open): Utilized a Custom Lightweight CNN that achieved 98.70% accuracy. This CNN was selected for deployment due to its minimal latency compared to heavier models, optimizing real-time performance.

Yawn Detection (Hybrid Approach): Employed a novel Hybrid MAR-CNN strategy for robust mouth state analysis. This method confirms a yawning event only when both the geometric Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) threshold and the CNN classifier indicate a yawn simultaneously. This dual verification significantly reduces false alarms triggered by non-drowsy actions like talking or smiling.
